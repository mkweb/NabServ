This is an alternate Server for Nabaztags writtern in PHP.

This Server includes a Api which can be viewed in http://nabaztag.mk-web.at/demo/, the User-Frontend and some testscripts like Choreographie-Creator (http://nabaztag.mk-web.at/tests/).
Every data is stored in serialized files, so no Database is required.

Server-Requirements:
* PHP > 5.3		(use of namespaces)
* Apache > 2.0
* phpdocumentator 	(To create the documentation)

If requirements are met everything should run out of the box without any additional configuration.

Planned steps:
* Complete Source documentation
* Adding community functions like sending a message to a friend's rabit or get 2 rabits married
* easy Language switch (at the moment default is English - to change this to german, set \base\Lang::init('en'); to \base\Lang::init('de');
